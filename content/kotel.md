MTProto protocol is not developer-friendly, or maybe I am just dumb/don't have enough time. I never managed to finish this project which consists of three libraries:

- [koTL](https://github.com/kotlin-telegram/koTL) â€“ Kotlin library to parse TL Language with kotlinx.serialization
- [ktproto](https://github.com/kotlin-telegram/ktproto) â€“ Kotlin library to work with Telegram's MTProto protocol
- kotel^[Kotel itself was never implemented] â€“ High-level TelegramClient implementation

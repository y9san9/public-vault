## Yandex

> 2024 - now

[Yandex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex) is my current place of employment. My role is an Android Architect in [go.yandex](https://go.yandex) project. Not much info here, besides that I have a lot of interesting tasks which require research and I love doing that.

## MTS

> 2023 - 2024

[MTS](https://ir.mts.ru/home) is my first product-focused company that I worked in. No more switches between projects and focus on a single project. Definitely this slows down grow speed, but now I want to grow into architecture and management, which is not something that requires to work with various technologies.

Starting as a Senior Kotlin Developer, I quickly managed to handle Architecture Tasks and Team Interaction. I participated in development of the library for chats much like Telegram. Our SDK then was integrated in a lot of different projects developed and maintained by MTS.

My responsibility was to design library in such a way that API will be flexible and extensible. That requires good architecture decision and knowledge of widely used patterns for Kotlin Libraries development. 

I also led Android Development Team and communicated a lot with other teams to find such solutions that will satisfy everyone.

## IceRock

> 2021 - 2023

When I was 17, I got my first real job. However, I qualified to the job already as a Middle Developer thanks to the previous freelance experience. [IceRock](https://github.com/icerockdev) is a cool company driving [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) to the masses.

IceRock is outsource company and having such company as a first work experience is awesome. I worked on various kinds of projects. Including some new projects with latest technologies like Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, kotlinx.coroutines, ktor. And some painfully old projects as well with technologies like Java, RxJava, DataBinding, etc.

I got known with a lot of technologies and was leaving the company as a Senior Kotlin Developer. As I mentioned, it was great **first** work experience, but not great work experience in general. IceRock had management problems which led to overtimes and my second burn out in 19 (LoL).

## Freelance

> 2017 - 2020

As soon as I turned 14, which is required legal age to work in my country, I started to work in freelance. There were a lot of different projects mostly in Java. There also was a lot of unpleasant experience with floating deadlines, uncertain technical specifications and this was hell of a job. A burned out for the first time in 16 years old.

I also had a lot of side-activities in Kotlin, which might be important to you. Consider to read [[Hard Skills]] note as well.

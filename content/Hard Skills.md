# Hard Skills

I love programming in all kinds. I am not fixed to any language, so I have some experience in various directions. 

> [!important] Notice
> My 'Job Language' is [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) in the context of [Android Framework](https://developer.android.com/) and if it's what you are interested in, please follow [[Work Experience]] link.

## Summary

**Programming:** since 2018
**Languages:** Kotlin (prod), Haskell (pet), Scala (pet), Rust (pet), F# (pet), Clojure (pet), Swift (pet), JS/NodeJS/TS (prod), Java (prod), Python (prod), Go (pet), PHP (pet).

## Architecture & Developer Experience

> from 2024

This year my focus shifted to Architecture and Developer Experience. I always was interested in that direction and researched a lot, but in 2024 it became my main focus in development as well as Developer Experience related stuff (CI/CD, Development Culture, etc.). 

This is continuation of vector defined in early 2023: "It became very interesting for me to make something that would not just benefit end users, but other developers".

## Libraries Development

> from 2023

From this year, it became very interesting for me to make something that would not just benefit end users, but other developers. I started to write my own libraries, include various commercial at work. 

## Public Activity

> from 2022

My journey in [[Public Activity]] started from taking part in Mobius conference with a [[Public Activity#^3576df|talk]] about KMP and why it is so different from all existing approaches.

## Functional Programming

> from 2021

This year I learned a lot of interesting stuff. My goal was to understand what Monad is ðŸ¤ª.  So I took some time to learn Theory Of Categories. Was playing a lot around Scala, Haskell and Rust. Till this day I value this time a lot.

## Kotlin Multiplatform

> 2021 - 2023

Learned how to write Kotlin programs and compile them to literally everything. I developed in Kotlin/Multiplatform on these targets: Android, iOS, JVM, JS (frontend), NodeJS (backend), MacOS (native), Linux (native).

## Backend

> 2020 - 2021

I always wrote small servers in PHP, but during this time I decided to have some experience with 'real' languages. There were some projects in Kotlin (Ktor Server, Exposed, Spring), Python (Flask, Django, Fastapi), TypeScript (NestJS, NextJS, Fastify).

## Kotlin/NodeJS

> 2020

After some experience with frontend in Kotlin/JS, I started to write backend in Kotlin/NodeJS. You might ask why not Kotlin/JVM? The answer is that those backends required to work with [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) (which is something like selenium, but better). It is a tool to control chromium browser and is only available in NodeJS.

## Kotlin/JS

> 2020

Now-JVM Kotlin? I discovered that I could develop sites in Kotlin. And I had some experience with TypeScript and was kinda familiar with Web Development, so it wasn't really hard to start using Kotlin/JS. I liked this experience a lot, even though it was tough at the start and required communication with the developers of Kotlin/JS itself.

## Kotlin Android

> 2018 - 2020

I moved fully to Kotlin Stack and tried ktor-client and various kotlinx-libraries. Still in Android though.

## Java Android

> 2017 - 2018

My first attempts to enter Android Development with me [[Work Experience#Freelance|actually working]] in freelance.  I tried MV* architectures, RxJava, Retrofit, Clean and other mainstream technologies at that point of time.

## Telegram

> from 2018

I wrote my first bots in Python and TypeScript using frameworks like [aiogram](https://aiogram.dev/), [telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf). Later I started to use [ktbotapi](https://github.com/InsanusMokrassar/ktgbotapi) for my bots (which is Kotlin Bot Api library). 

Then I started to develop userbots and tried [pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/), [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) and [mtcute](https://github.com/mtcute/mtcute).  This passion towards Telegram led to start of the [[kotel]] project.
